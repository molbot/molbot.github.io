You may be wondering to yourself right now about why I chose to make a page dedicated to <i>Spaghetti Squash</i>, 
this is not just a cool new food fad, its a <b>fun</b>,<b> healthy </b>, and <b>protein packed</b> meal that more people should be aware of... if you ask me.
</p>
<p>
In case you have never encountered a spaghetti squash, they are large oval squashes that have a melon-like appearence. The color of their rinds can range from crayola <font color="yellow"> YELLOW </font> It is referred to as <i> Spahghetti </i> squash becuase when cooked, the inside becomes string like... resembling angel hair pasta. 
</p>
<p>
When preparing the Spaghetti Squash, one should treat it the same way as if you were about to carve a pumpkin for halloween. Meaning the seeds on the inside need to be scooped out so you can get to the good stuff! Once thw insides have been scooped out, the way you choose to cook your squash is completely up to you. My personal favorite is to bake it in the oven and cook additional topping separately. If baking is not your favorite way to cook, you can also steam, roast, and even microwave your Spaghetti Squash. </p>
